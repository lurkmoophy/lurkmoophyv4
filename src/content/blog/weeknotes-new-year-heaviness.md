The air feels heavy, doesn’t it?

We’re four weeks into the new year, and already there is so much shit in the world that keeps happening (primarily thanks to one orange-faced prick). On a personal level, I’m really trying to find the joy in this year, but these four weeks have felt like carrying a backpack full of bricks, with the straps pulled tight so it’s sitting right on the top of the shoulders.

The thing that I’m struggling with mostly is that the last four weeks haven’t been bad on a personal level. I feel like I’m running at work (albeit, it’s still a bit ‘build the car whilst it’s flying down the highway as per), I’ve managed a little escape to the Jurassic Coast for a weekend, [played one of my favourite venues in London](https://www.instagram.com/p/DT9pLnjjCzE/?igsh=b3l2dnNtOTU5ZmJy), kicked off planning for [the best festival](https://www.indeifjord.com/) in the world, and even flexed some creative muscles in both [code](https://lurkmoophy.com/side-projects/) and [design](https://lurkmoophy.com/illustration/).

That balance of being happy, comfortable, and fulfilled in your personal life while the world seems like it’s going to absolute hell feels hard right now. I feel selfish for wanting to focus on personal happiness when I know it’s one of the only things that’s within my control. At the same time, I feel like I’m not *doing* enough when it comes to fixing the world. Fuck, I’m not really doing anything, apart from ranting at whoever will listen. 

Can the world please unfuck itself?

Anyway, here’s a calming video of the waves at Durdle Door.
