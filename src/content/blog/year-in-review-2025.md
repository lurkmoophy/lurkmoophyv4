   # A Year of Lurking

   (Wow that sounds bad...)

I absolutely love end-of-year lists and wrapups. I also spend way too much time logging things I consume and enjoy. Not so much in a 'quantify my life and optimise' way of the quantifiable-self tech bro movement, but more so I can look back and see what I've been spending my time on because I have the memory of a pigeon. 2025 was an eventful year – I got married (Marriage 2: Electric Boogaloo), started another company that will drain my money, switched back to advocacy in my [day job](https://www.zeroheight.com/), released an album, asnd built too many Lego sets. 2025 was also a slightly troubling year, in that the world feels like it's actively going to shit, and not really turning around quickly enough. 

While I figure out my thoughts on 2025, I think it's good to look back and see what brought joy. So, here we go... a whole bunch of lists. Let's go.

## My year in music

According to the streaming giant I won't name, I listened to 42,383 minutes of music this year, which is about 4,000 minutes less than the previous year. I think this because I commuted less, and also wrote more. I can't work on anything that requires thinking power with music on, which translates to about 10 minutes less music listening than 2024. However, at the same time I also went to way more gigs than 2024 and bought more vinyl. These are two that I don't quantify, purely because I'd hate to see the effect both have on my bank account, when they're two things that bring me immense joy.

Numbers aside, 2025 was a pretty amazing year for music. I purposely branched out into different genres of music (hello hyperpop, hardcore and K-Pop), and also dove deeper into the UK DIY scene (in large part thanks to Nothing Sounds Good). Some people I am lucky enough to know personally put out some amazing music this year, including *Soot Sprite*, *Really Big, Really Clever*, *Every Face Becomes a Skull*, *The Losing Score*, *Regal Cheer*, *H_ngm_n*, *SUDS*, and my doppelganger, *George Gadd*. The state of UK DIY is in amazing shape, and I've probably missed out on some amazing EPs and singles from this list too.

Anyway, here's my top five albums and honourable mentions, as well as my favourite gigs from the year.

<div class="yir25--list">

### Luke's Top Albums of 2025

1. <img src="/images/yir25-poolkids.png" alt="Pool Kids - Easier Said Than Done" class="yir25-list-image yir25-list-image-album">***Pool Kids* - Easier Said Than Done**
   
   A beautiful record that seamlessly blends pop, indie, and emo. The legends in *Dikembe* put me onto this record earlier in the year and my god, what a record. The title track, 'Easier Said Than Done', is hands down one of my favourite songs of the last ten years, and lifts my mood instantly.
   

2. <img src="/images/yir25-sootsprite.png" alt="Soot Sprite - Wield Your Hope Like a Weapon" class="yir25-list-image yir25-list-image-album">***Soot Sprite* - Wield Your Hope Like a Weapon**
   
   This record absolutely floored me when I first heard it. The mix of emo and shoegaze, with Eli's delicate vocals over their incredible music that shifts from wall of noise to soft and sweet with effortless skill, is unmatched. *Soot Sprite* should be one of the biggest bands in the world.

3. <img src="/images/yir25-thebeths.png" alt="The Beths - Straight Line Was A Lie" class="yir25-list-image yir25-list-image-album">***The Beths* - Straight Line Was A Lie**
   
   In my opinion, *The Beths* can do no wrong. Their rise to the top of indie-pop circles is hugely deserved, and the songwriting on this album is a masterclass. 'Mother, Pray For Me' breaks my heart every time I hear it.

4. <img src="/images/yir25-efbas.png" alt="Every Face Becomes a Skull - Be of Good Cheer" class="yir25-list-image yir25-list-image-album">***Every Face Becomes a Skull* - Be of Good Cheer**
   
   One of the most surprising additions to my list, *EFBAS* have always been a great, solid band, but fuck me, *Be of Good Cheer* hits incredibly hard. It's 18 and a half minutes of solid screamo/hardcore/I'm not even sure what. This album is the best heavy release this year.

5. <img src="/images/yir25-suds.png" alt="SUDS - Tell Me About Your Day Again" class="yir25-list-image yir25-list-image-album">***SUDS* - Tell Me About Your Day Again**
   
   In a similar vein to *Soot Sprite*, this mix of shoegaze and emo is a masterclass in songwriting. I'd heard a lot about *SUDS* over the last five years, and when we played with them in April supporting *Dikembe*, I had high hopes. Those hopes were exceeded, and the album that came out at the end of this year is fucking great.

<div class="yir25--list--hm">

**Honourable mentions:** *DURRY - This Movie Sucks*, *H_ngm_n - Paper Streets* (finally), *George Gadd & The Aftermath - Too Many Ghosts…*, *Turnstile - NEVER ENOUGH*, *Michael Cera Palin - We Could Be Brave*, *jasmine.4.t - You are the Morning*, *MUDRAT - SOCIAL COHESION*

</div>

### Luke's Top Gigs of 2025

1. **Knocked Loose - The Underworld, 14 March 2025**
   
   *Knocked Loose* at the Underworld. Lived up to the hype, and seeing them in this small a venue was insane.

2. **Press Club - Bedford Esquires, 6 July 2025**
   
   A perfect live band in a great little venue, but they played it like they were playing Brixton Academy.

3. **Turnstile - Alexandra Palace, 5 November 2025**
   
   As much as I hate Ally Pally, *Turnstile* was an experience. I've never seen circle pits so big.

4. **Fresh & Mammoth Penguins - The Lexington, 9 January 2025**
   
   The gig that kicked off my year of gigs. *Fresh* never disappoint, and *Mammoth Penguins* are just absolutely joyous.

5. **Brutallixmas - The Victoria, 19 December 2025**
   
   Cheeky, but this year's Brutallixmas was perfect. Three amazing bands (and us), and I got to watch Simo crowdsurf while playing bass during our annual RATM cover.

</div>

## My year in films

2025 was an ok year for watching films. I managed to log 47 films in total, which is probably not all of them, as I'm sure I didn't log some favourites that were comfort rewatches (especially Christmas films). I did try and get out of the house and get to the cinema at least a couple times every month, and managed to see some absolute gems (Ballad, Sinners and One Battle) and some absolute stinkers because of that (Dog Man. So bad).

I managed to catch up on some absolute beauties from previous years, like Robot Dreams, and finally got around to watching some old films that have probably now snuck into my top ten of all time, like Meet Me In St Louis (how have I not seen this before). The Ballad of Wallis Island taking the top spot is not that surprising, considering it feels like it's tailor made for me. Music + Tim Key + awkward comedy + sadness is a winning combination. If you haven't seen it yet, it's an absolute beauty of a film.

## My year in books

I set myself an ambitious target of 35 books for 2025, and managed to smash it with 47 in total (and I'm about 50% of the way through my last one, but didn't quite get it in). I managed to sneak in a few non-fiction, as well as my usual fare of sci-fi, fantasy and dystopia. Dungeon Crawler Carl feels like it's rewired my brain. It's such a fun, stupid, exciting series, and I can't wait for the next entry. I also finished off both the Legends & Lattes and Her Majesty's Royal Coven series' thanks to my partner's access to ARCs, which was neat. Both are excellent series.

However, it was a reread in Don't Hold My Head Down that quietly snuck into my top five books of the year. I think this is an essential read for anyone who wants to understand more about human intimacy and how much culture and existing systems screw with it, delivered as a really funny, engaging memoir. More people need to read this.

## My year in side projects

It's pretty funny that I started and shelved an event called 'Side Quest' this year, considering my inability to not do side quests. Writing these down made me realise that I still do too many things. This year, I co-launched a new vinyl subscription startup called Nothing Sounds Good, which has been a great way to spend my time each month finding records and writing the zine for it. It's a shame it hasn't taken off like I thought it would, but it still brings me so much joy each month. Still on the music side, I launched two music podcasts (and shelved one), released an album with my band, ran another successful all-dayer (as well as a handful of gigs). That makes me feel pretty accomplished.

On the more work side of things, I helped run WDC again, which is always a highlight of the year, found my joy in coding again via this website and a bunch of projects at work, and started the aforementioned Side Quest. That's not counting the conferences, podcasts, speaking gigs and stupid projects I do at work too. It's been a busy year.

The only thing I think I did purely for myself and didn't really shout about is actually build a gym habit. I've managed to keep up at least twice a week most weeks of the year, and have slowly been building the amount of weight I can lift without destroying my body. It's slow, it's gradual, but I'm feeling so much better in myself. Go me.

<div class="yir25--list yir25--list-stacked">

### Side Quests Started

<details><summary>Side Quest</summary>

[Side Quest](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lukeandrewmurphy_side-quest-002-activity-7368682839174856704-G7dG?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAIkzFoB8Ob8xzWQePdGmqL3wMietQdIq3w) is an event for tech folks (and others) to talk about the side projects they do. We ran two events in London, and they were both excellent. 

</details>
<details><summary>Nothing Sounds Good</summary>

A friend and I started a [vinyl subscription company](https://www.nothingsoundsgood.club/) for DIY indie and punk earlier in the year. I sold my first vinyl subscription, Wax & Stamp, back in 2020, so it's been nice to get back into it, especially making the zine every month.

</details>
<details><summary>This website</summary>

Inspired by [Henry](https://henry.codes/) at WDC, I decided to finally give my website a facelift and make it more me. I've been (mostly) keeping up with it, too!

</details>
<details><summary>WDC 2025</summary>

Technically, this has been going for a long time, but I hosted and co-organised another [WDC conference](https://www.webdevconf.com/) in Bristol this year, and it filled my heart with joy to get so many cool web people together in one room. It was also the biggest one we've done in a very long time!

</details>
<details><summary>HTMF Podcast</summary>

At the beginning of the year, I [started a new podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/6yrX2kjLuJ3iQVGft072yV?si=ad65f4a126b74f7e) where I talk to DIY band folks about what goes into creating, running and maintaining a DIY band in 2025. I think there's so much knowledge that could be shared around this stuff, and I wanted to get it out there!

</details>
<details><summary>Brutalligators Podcast</summary>

To celebrate the album, we did a [track-by-track breakdown](https://open.spotify.com/show/1jK2IvUeh5pvmWrr4teV8l?si=4642b16bff7b4f6c) as a band, which was pretty fun. Not many people listened to it, but hey, we enjoyed it.

</details>
<details><summary>HTMF All-dayer 2025</summary>

Another one that is technically a continuing thing, but I'm pretty proud of the fact that yet again we got [a great lineup](https://www.instagram.com/p/DPM1swECCvN/) and managed to get over 100 people to buy tickets. I'm not a shit promoter, I suppose.

</details>
<details><summary>Brutalligators Album</summary>

The world needs [more emo from over forty-year-olds](https://open.spotify.com/album/6GKNtOAcMXkI14OS3OKvee?si=5NHEToaWT7uV4t7yfRy5tA), so we delivered our second record.

</details>
<details><summary>Illustrating gig posters</summary>

Another one that is just ticking along from previous years, but this year I've got to [illustrate some posters](https://lurkmoophy.com/illustration/) for some excellent bands! I even tried to [turn one](https://lurkmoophy.com/posters/crywank/) into a fully responsive web page with animations. 

</details>
<details><summary>Going to the gym</summary>

I managed to actually build a gym routine this year, which I'm super proud of. Who knew that picking up weights at least twice a week could actually make you feel good about yourself!?

</details>

   </div>
   <div class="yir25--stack">

### Side Quests Ended

<details><summary>Side Quest</summary>

Started and ended in 2025. It was just taking up too much of my brainspace, and there weren't quite as many people interested in a non-focused side projects event as I thought there'd be. So, I made the decision to shelve it for the moment.

</details>
<details><summary>HTMF Podcast</summary>

Similarly, the amount of work and effort required to lock down guests was just taking up too much brain space. I loved doing the podcast, but with everything else going on, I thought it was time to put it on ice after a handful of episodes.

</details>
<details><summary>The print business</summary>

Technically still running, but my god, sales have slowed down. [It's still there](https://www.etsy.com/shop/lurkmoophy?ref=seller-platform-mcnav), but I've decided to not actively add anything for the foreseeable future. But hey, if you want some scandi art that says 'fuck shit up', you know where to find it.

</details>

<div class="yir25--list">

### Next year in Side Quests

I'm hoping 2026 settles down slightly in terms of side quests... I want to grow Nothing Sounds Good to a point where it at least runs itself (packaging vinyl each month does not fill me with joy). I'd love to keep up the gym habit and not look like a fat piece of shit. I'd also not like to start any long-term commitments this year, as I feel I've already got a few of those.

In saying that, I still have the band. I've also said yes to helping out with [Indiefjord](https://indiefjord.com/), which I've been attending and DJing at since 2016. WDC will be back in 2026, and I'm sure I'll be promoting a hell of a lot of gigs. So basically, not adding anything *else* to me plate would be helpful.

</div>

## Ins and Outs for 2026

To cap it all off here are the things I think are going to be in and out for 2026. This is, of course, based on extensive research and ethnographic study, and not just based on vibes at the end of December. Overall, let's bring back joy, decency, and empathy. Let's yeet fascism, late-stage capitalism, and post-punk into the sea. Let's make 2026 a good one, yeah?
