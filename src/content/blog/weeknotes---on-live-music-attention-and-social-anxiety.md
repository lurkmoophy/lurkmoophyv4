## I want to find joy in seeing music again

Last week I went to a gig and actually enjoyed it. That sounds like a daft statement to make about myself, when from the outside it looks like I go to lots of gigs. And to be fair, I do go to a fair number. Last year I counted 29 gigs, and I’m sure I forgot a few. That’s 1 gig every two weeks. The only saving grace is that 13 of them were gigs I was playing, but still. What I’ve found more and more over the last year or two is that I’m enjoying live music less, which quite frankly, sucks.

A large part of it is social anxiety. Being in a crowd of people I don’t know, especially in a context where I want to be liked, sets my brain into overdrive. One of the cool things about playing in a band that plays a fair bit is you slowly start to recognise people and become acquaintances with a lot of them. However, instead of making this better, somehow it makes things worse because it puts my brain into “do you say hello; do you wait for them to say hello; what happens when you run out of things to say; how do you make conversation again; what was their name because they definitely told you last time; actually is that even the person you know; when did you last see them; what if they ignore me” mode.

The second part is my inability to pay attention to something for more than ten minutes. Unless I know the band’s discography back to front, my brain is incapable of standing still and paying attention to a band for more than 2-3 songs. This has nothing to do with how good the band are (although if a band is SUPER engaging, I’ll probably last 4 songs), it’s just that after about 3 songs my brain is telling me that I need to be somewhere else. It’s why I *love* being able to look up a set list before a show so I can be familiar with as many songs as possible. Otherwise, I’m going outside and will be back shortly after.

I’m not a fan of acting this way with live music, because I also genuinely love going to gigs. Last week, by chance, I went to see [Fresh](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0q2GJGveytu4IRflsL05Xg?si=uIfTYh5UTiOndm41ZXUc1w) and [Mammoth Penguins](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4xBSK0hu7wFitcyc1Zjg8U?si=X7C4mbdBTj-JfhQ1lox_iA) at The Lexington (I missed [Atlanta Dream Season](https://open.spotify.com/artist/64kwXrgUE8KMvflTAQkFT2?si=rjibEk1FQzaZv-mJs1-nBA), which is a big shame). I had plans, but they ended early, so I thought I’d head along and see if I could get in. I think the lack of pre-planning probably helped (low stakes), and to be fair, Fresh are a band where I know *most* of the songs, but I came out of the gig having watched Fresh by myself (which is usually a good recipe for self-loathing), and was feeling very happy and positive and in love with music.

So that’s another thing I’m trying to do this year – focus on loving live music again. Or at least being kinder to myself if I pop out for a breather halfway through a set and then come back later.

## Current Book:

When I was a lot younger I absolutely adored Perks of Being a Wallflower, and that was the main reason I picked this book up. I didn’t realise it was horror, which is not a genre I usually enjoy, but I’m about three quarters of the way through this doorstop of a novel and genuinely enjoying the creepiness of it. It doesn’t hurt that the characters are great, even if it’s borrowing *heavily* from Stephen King. However, the hissing lady did visit me in a nightmare last week, so I might have to switch to non-horror again after this.

## Current Music:

I’ve gone back to Little Simz’ 2022 banger [NO THANK YOU](https://open.spotify.com/album/57263zG8Md6XZ9lBUPPYCm?si=IKCbpMZ0QjadvEw3hwBfUQ) last week. I’ve been seeing Doechii’s DENIAL IS A RIVER everywhere (which I also love), which made me really want to listen to Little Simz for some reason. I love a bit of jazzy influence in hip-hop, and Little Simz is so chill and *fucking cool*. Of course Gorilla is the standout track, but the whole album is a vibe from start to finish.
